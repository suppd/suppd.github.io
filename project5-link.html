        <h3>Project Details</h3>
        <p>This project has been going on for years at Thales it's a student project that get's new members every half a year, my group was just 3 people. me a designer and an artist, during this project we worked on reworking a mission into a tutorial since the game was lacking one. In the GIF above you can see an early prototype of the tutorial system I made during my internship.</p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>This project taught me a lot about working in large codebases with a lot of diffrent code authors and how to approach this, it also taught me a lot about about how project management works in a corporate environment thanks to the project manager at Thales. I learned a lot about how we should define tasks when planning sprints learned a lot about scope by making mistakes when planning but atleast I learned from my mistakes which I think was a good thing.</p>
