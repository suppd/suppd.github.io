            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Eggsplosion was a school project me and 5 fellow students worked on for about 10 weeks, me being the only engineer on the team. This was my first team project that went beyond 2-3 weeks, which meant I learned a lot about scale of production in (game) development and especially to never underestimate the polishing phase. The game's entire concept was created by us students with the only guide lines being the time frame and the assignment, create a multiplayer game for a convention.</p>

        <h3>My Role On The Project</h3>
        <p>My role on the project mostly invovled anything to do with engineering, the team consisted of 1 engineer (me), 3 designers and 2 artists. Since one of the designers knew how to code a little bit I wasnt the only programmer but since I had more experience that meant I was the one in charge of all programming related things, like managing the git repository building frameworks and systems like the ability system that made it so that creating another ability was relatively easy for my designers. </p>
        
        <h3>Code Worked On</h3>
        <p>The main systems I worked on during this project were, the leaderboard-score system, steam API integration, lobby system, ability base system and player systems.</p>

        <p>The lobby system (works with steam remote play):</p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>Since this was my first big project as a (semi) professional, I learned quite a lot of things for example me having to sacrafice time and energy to help other member of my team with their code being the lead programmer on the team. Also I learned to never underestimate the polishing phase again since this project was going relatively smooth until we got to the poloshing phase thats where the work really started to pile up. </p>
        <p>All in all i would say this project really helped develop not only my programming skills but also my team work skills and also my condiseration of fellow programmers. </p>
